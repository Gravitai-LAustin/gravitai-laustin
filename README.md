## 🧠 About Me

I'm a transformation consultant and ERP strategist focused on delivering smart, scalable, and human-centric business systems. At **Gravitai**, I lead complex Odoo ERP implementations that blend technical precision with commercial insight — turning fragmented processes into streamlined digital ecosystems.

From initial discovery to final deployment, I translate client needs into achievable roadmaps backed by solid feasibility scoring and realistic effort planning (aka *Bricks*). Whether it's quoting, system design, or full delivery, I aim for solutions that are as elegant as they are effective.
